A simple checkers game that will be used to teach students basic 
JavaScript concepts which include objects and arrays.

A two player game played on a 8 by 8 checkers board. Each player is given
12 pieces which are placed on the light squares of the checkers board.

The black player is allowed to go first. Players alternate in turns.
A player may only make diagonal forward moves toward the opponent.
There are two types of moves, capturing and non-capturing moves. A
non-capturing move involves moving to a non-occupied diagonal space.
If an opponent is in a diaganol square and the square
behind the opponent is empty, then the move is a capturing move by
leaping over the opponent. Only one piece may be captured in a single
jump.  The player can capture the opponents piece and remove it from the
board. If the square behind the opponent is not empty then the player
cannot capture the opponent. 

The games is finalized when all of the losing player's pieces have been
removed from the board.
